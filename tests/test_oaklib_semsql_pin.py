"""The oaklib pin must keep `sqlite:obo:` off the retired semantic-sql S3 bucket (#646).

INCATools/semantic-sql removed public read from the raw S3 bucket
(semantic-sql#112). oaklib below 0.7.2 resolves `sqlite:obo:` selectors against
it; 0.7.2 moved the default to the CDN. This repo stayed on 0.6.23 — the last
pre-CDN release — long enough for the bucket to start answering 403, at which
point the eight adapters in conf/id_label_targets.yaml and every
`sqlite:obo:{onto}` in scripts/ground_categories.py were aimed at nothing on a
cache miss.

The reversion is invisible until it is catastrophic. With `~/.data/oaklib/`
warm, every lookup still succeeds on 0.6.23, so no test, gate or error message
distinguishes a correct pin from a reverted one — right up until a cache miss.
That includes the id↔label gate, which downloads through this path.

These assert the floor, not the installed version: CI resolves from the lock,
and a developer may legitimately be ahead.

Ported from MediaIngredientMech's guard of the same name.
