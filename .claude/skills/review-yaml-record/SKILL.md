# Review one ProteinTraitsMech YAML record

- Repository: `CultureBotAI/proteintraitsmech`
- Records: `data/traits/**/*.yaml`
- Schema: `src/proteintraitsmech/schema/proteintraitsmech.yaml`

## The Contract

<!-- canonical:begin the-contract -->
Produce a read-only judgement of one record: what is sound, what is unsupported
or internally inconsistent, what is materially incomplete, and what bounded
checks would resolve the remaining uncertainty.

Reviewing is not curation. A review request authorizes reads, validation
commands, one new structured YAML/Markdown review bundle described below, and
a concise final summary; it does not authorize editing a record, regenerating
products, spending provider credits, contacting anyone, or creating or mutating
GitHub issues, pull requests, comments, labels, or settings.

Resolve exactly one target before judging anything. If a label, slug, or
identifier matches several records, stop and disambiguate; a thorough review of
the wrong record is still wrong.

Read the entire target file before making a finding. Projections, indexes,
rendered pages, and search snippets are useful leads, but they hide context and
cannot support a record-level verdict on their own.
<!-- canonical:end the-contract -->

## Scope

<!-- canonical:begin scope -->
Review records from this repository's declared corpus, including an exact frozen
snapshot row when the local profile uses that surface. Read
`docs/record-review-profile.md` for the active native review entrypoints, local
rubrics, validators, and maintained input ownership. A curation skill is not a
prerequisite for reviewing a record.

For a generated record, identify the maintained table, overlay, source transform
or seeder that owns a future fix. Do not patch records, generated artifacts,
pages, caches, or cross-repository outputs. Only the new review bundle is written.

Preserve local claim types, priority rules, scoring definitions, and scientific
status/history gates. The shared shape standardizes observations; it does not
replace the Mech's field-by-field rubric or authorize status promotion.
<!-- canonical:end scope -->

## Evidence Rules

<!-- canonical:begin evidence-rules -->
- Verify every stable identifier, DOI, PMID, ontology CURIE, source accession,
  and internal reference that the record relies on.
- Attach evidence to the narrowest claim it supports. A source that supports
  one definition, member, mechanism edge, ingredient, example, or organism does
  not automatically support the whole record.
- Treat search results, raw research reports, generated summaries, and rendered
  pages as leads. Only inspected source text can support a claim.
- Keep direct quotations short and exact. Interpretation belongs in notes or in
  the review report, not inside quoted snippets.
- Preserve scope. Evidence about one strain, protein, medium formulation,
  habitat, condition, or experiment is not evidence for a broader class unless
  the source makes that generalization.
- Preserve conflicts. If two inspected sources disagree, report the
  disagreement and its scope instead of choosing the convenient one.
- A near miss is not a match. Do not ground a record to a plausible broader or
  adjacent term; leave unsupported identity claims flagged as unresolved.
<!-- canonical:end evidence-rules -->

## Structured Source Cross-Checks

<!-- canonical:begin structured-source-cross-checks -->
Use structured source adapters before open-ended web search when this record
names a gene, locus tag, UniProt accession, regulator, pathway, stress response,
trait, or transcriptomics dataset that may already be represented in a shared
database.

For iModulonDB candidates, first resolve the runner. In the commands below,
`<kg-microbe-sources>` means either an installed `kg-microbe-sources` console
script or `uv run --project <claw-root> kg-microbe-sources` from a local
`culturebotai-claw` checkout. If neither runner is available, record the
structured adapter as unavailable and fall back to inspected iModulonDB source
pages or open web search.

- Run `<kg-microbe-sources> imodulondb datasets` to find covered
  organism/dataset keys.
- Run `<kg-microbe-sources> imodulondb search --organism <organism> --dataset
  <dataset> --query <term>` for a record gene, locus, regulator, protein name,
  stress-response term, or iModulon name that matches a covered organism.
- Run `<kg-microbe-sources> imodulondb summarize --organism <organism>
  --dataset <dataset> --k <component>` for any iModulon hit that would inform
  the record verdict.
- Record useful `organism/dataset/component` and `organism/dataset/gene` keys
  under **Evidence** or **Additional Notes**, and keep any copied summary table
  small enough to justify why the record is or is not supported.

iModulon membership is computational expression-module evidence. It can support
a bounded transcriptomic context finding for a covered strain, gene, regulator,
or protein, but it is not direct proof of a phenotype, MIC, natural-product
identity, cell-structure localization, habitat assertion, medium recipe, or
medium-ingredient identity. If no covered organism/dataset matches the target,
write that iModulonDB was not applicable; absence from iModulonDB is not
negative evidence.
<!-- canonical:end structured-source-cross-checks -->

## Missing Things

<!-- canonical:begin missing-things -->
Before reporting that a record, source file, evidence object, decision row,
overlay, generated product, or referenced artifact is absent, search for the
identifier, label, and slug with a gitignore-independent search such as
`rg --no-ignore --hidden`, `rg -uu`, `grep -r`, or `find`.

Say what the exhaustive search covered. If you used an ordinary ignored-aware
search, call the miss provisional.
<!-- canonical:end missing-things -->

## Workflow

<!-- canonical:begin workflow -->
1. Read the local guidance that names exact validators and write boundaries:
   `CLAUDE.md`, `justfile`, `docs/record-review-profile.md`, its local rubrics,
   and `docs/record-reviews.md` for the shared output contract.
2. Resolve one record under the declared corpus or native frozen-row selector. Confirm
   its class, identifier, label, source provenance, grounding status, evidence
   entries, discussion or quality flags, generated status, and curation history
   shape.
3. Run the schema, strict, term, reference, and history validators documented
   for this record in this repository. Do not invent a focused validator for a
   category the repository exposes only as a full-corpus check; run the
   narrowest documented validator and report any full-corpus-only, missing
   dependency, cache, network, or skipped check.
4. Verify identity first: confirm the file denotes the requested biological or
   chemical thing, not a sibling, example, variant, source artifact, generated
   copy, or similarly named class.
5. Apply the local checklist claim by claim. For every material assertion, say
   whether the nearest cited source supports exactly that claim.
6. Classify findings by severity:
   **blocker** for wrong identity, invalid YAML, broken references, or a claim
   that makes the record denote the wrong thing;
   **major** for unsupported evidence, wrong ontology grounding, scope
   inflation, a missing required representation, or a systemic curation bug;
   **minor** for style, weak wording, redundant evidence, or non-blocking
   provenance gaps.
7. Report the exact follow-up: which maintained input should change, which
   generator should be rerun, which validator would prove the fix, and which
   uncertainty remains genuinely unresolved.
<!-- canonical:end workflow -->

## Output

<!-- canonical:begin output -->
Save one immutable structured review bundle for the resolved record
using the CLAW-governed contract in `docs/record-reviews.md` and
`schema/record_review.yaml`. Preserve the local rubric identified by
`docs/record-review-profile.md`.

- Capture actual UTC start/finish, reviewer identity and independence, exact
  target IDs/locators, Git base, input hashes, and generated-input owners.
- Retain every check and its real result, domain assessments, inspected evidence,
  normalized findings, native rules/severity rationale, proposed actions with
  acceptance checks, and explicit limitations. Do not equate a deterministic
  check with scientific review.
- Use `kind: record`; it identifies exactly one target.
- Invoke `uv run python scripts/record_review.py inspect --targets <targets.yaml>`
  before assessment, then `validate <completed-review.yaml>` and
  `save --content <completed-review.yaml>` with the same script. Recheck changed
  inputs instead of silently refreshing their hashes.
- The saver writes
  `reviews/structured/<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>-<slug>/review.yaml` plus `review.md`.
  YAML is authoritative; do not hand-edit the rendered Markdown or overwrite an
  earlier bundle. Run `uv run python scripts/record_review.py check` afterward.
- If required checks are unavailable after the target is resolved, save an honest
  partial/blocked observation. If the shared saver itself cannot run, report
  that persistence is blocked; session-only prose is not a saved review.
- Retain stable issue keys and exact `previous_occurrences` when reassessing a
  finding. A later clean report does not close earlier unresolved findings.
- Do not append curation/history events or promote native scientific status.
  Those require a separately authorized curation change and native gates.

Do not create a report for an unresolved ambiguous target. In the final response,
link both saved files and summarize scope, verdict, findings by severity, and
unavailable checks. Existing ad hoc Markdown is historical, not the output format
for new reviews.
