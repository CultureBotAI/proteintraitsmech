"""Validate that every ontology ID carries its correct ontology LABEL.

Shared, schema/config-driven id↔label correspondence checker. Vendored
**byte-identical** across the Mech repos (CultureMech / MIM / CommunityMech)
— the same convention as ``scripts/_edison_capture.py``. Verify with
``md5``; a fix here must be synced to all copies.

Why this exists
---------------
``linkml-term-validator validate-data --labels`` only checks that the
label of an ontology ID matches the ontology — and only for LinkML data
instances (YAML) whose schema declares a ``binding``. It does NOT cover
**data products**: SSSOM TSVs, mapping CSVs, KGX node tables, and review
TSVs all carry (id, label) columns that no LinkML tool reads. This script
closes that gap and also produces a single cross-surface drift report.

What it checks
--------------
For every (id, label) pair in the configured targets it resolves the
canonical label (and synonyms) from the same OAK sqlite adapters the
repos already use, and classifies the pair:

    OK_CANONICAL        label == canonical OBO label
    OK_SYNONYM          label is an accepted synonym (policy-dependent)
    OK_ID_ONLY          id resolves; label match WAIVED for this slot (the slot
                        carries a curator-intended formula/common name, e.g.
                        CHEBI:15377 "Distilled water" — see ``label_waived_keys``)
    OK_EXCEPTION        the exact (id, label) pair is on the target's
                        ``exceptions`` allow-list — a curator-accepted residual
                        (obsolete-no-successor, no clean term yet, or id absent
                        from the current ontology snapshot) carrying a documented
                        ``reason``. Overrides MISMATCH / ID_NOT_FOUND only; the
                        match is exact, so a different wrong label on the same id
                        still fails as MISMATCH.
    MISMATCH            label is neither canonical nor an accepted synonym  (ERROR)
    ID_NOT_FOUND        id has an adapter but is absent from the ontology   (ERROR)
    EMPTY_LABEL         id present, label blank                             (ERROR)
    MISSING_COLUMN      a CONFIGURED id/label column is absent from a       (ERROR)
                        tabular target that has data rows — without this the
                        pair silently drops and enforce false-greens on drift
    ADAPTER_ERROR       a CONFIGURED adapter failed to load                 (ERROR)
    UNKNOWN_PREFIX      CURIE prefix is neither a configured ontology       (ERROR)
                        adapter NOR an explicitly ``ignored_prefixes`` entry —
                        i.e. a typo (``CHBEI:``) or an unexpected new prefix.
                        Without this such ids silently fell through as
                        SKIPPED_NO_ADAPTER and enforce false-greened on them.
    SKIPPED_NO_ADAPTER  prefix is an explicitly ignored non-ontology prefix
                        (``cas:``, ``MIM:``, ``kgmicrobe.compound:`` …) or the
                        id has no CURIE prefix at all (e.g. ``UNMAPPED_0001``)
    SKIPPED_EMPTY_ADAPTER  configured adapter loaded but holds no terms (e.g. a
                        0-byte sqlite stub); db needs populating, data isn't wrong

Policy (per target, ``conf/id_label_targets.yaml``)
    ``canonical``            accept only the canonical OBO label (strict;
                             mirrors the linkml-term-validator schema gate).
    ``canonical_or_synonym`` accept canonical OR a synonym within
                             ``synonym_scope`` (exact | exact_related | all).

Per-target knobs (in addition to ``policy``/``synonym_scope``/``pairs``)
    ``required: true``       fail enforce when the target's glob matches NO
                             files (an expected artifact, e.g. an SSSOM export,
                             wasn't built). Default false preserves the prior
                             "skip-with-exit-0" behaviour for optional targets.
    ``label_waived_keys``    slots that carry curator-intended labels (formula /
                             common names) and so are EXEMPT from canonical-label
                             matching but STILL id-existence checked (OK_ID_ONLY
                             when the id resolves, ID_NOT_FOUND when it doesn't).
                             For YAML targets the entries match the *parent key*
                             of the id/label dict (e.g. ``term``, ``chebi_term``);
                             for tabular targets they match the *id column name*
                             (e.g. ``ontology_id``). This implements the product
                             decision to KEEP labels like "D-glucose" / "NaCl"
                             rather than relabel them to the OBO canonical form.
                             Unlike ``exclude_keys`` (which prunes the whole
                             subtree and checks nothing), label-waived slots are
                             still validated for id existence.

Modes
    ``--report PATH``  write a TSV of every non-OK pair and exit 0 (baseline).
    (default)          enforce: exit 2 if any ERROR-class pair is found.
